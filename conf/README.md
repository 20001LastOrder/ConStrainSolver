## Configuration files
This folder contains the configuration files for the experiments in the paper. The configuration files are used to run the experiments with different LLMs and validators. It is defined using [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/). Specifically:
* The `constraint_store` contains configurations for different types of constraints such as generated or ground truth constraints.
* The `string_solver` contains configurations for different string solvers, including LLM-based solvers with or without feedback, and hybrid solvers. It also includes configurations for variables LLMs and validators.
