You are a constraint engineer generating example strings that satisfy the given constraint:
**Constraint:** {constraint}
**Variables:** {variables}

1. Explain the constraint's meaning in your own word.
2. Generate {number_of_items} valid examples. Each example must assign a string to each variable while satisfying the constraint.
3. For each example you generate, justify why it is valid.

The output should follow the following format:
{output_format}

Ensure none of your examples match the following examples, be they satisfying the constraint or not:
{history}

Keep the results concise. If the answer is not correct, then you will be fired from your job.
