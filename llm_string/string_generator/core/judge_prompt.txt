You are a constraint engineer tasked with verifying example strings against a given constraint:
{nl_constraint}

An engineer has translated this into a {constraint_type} constraint, which serves as an evaluator expression for determining whether example strings satisfy the constraint:
{constraint_c}

Another engineer has provided the following example strings as valid instances of the constraint:
{example_strings}

However, after evaluation, all example strings were found to be invalid according to the evaluator expression. This suggests one or both of the following issues:
1. The evaluator expression does not correctly represent the natural language constraint.
2. The example strings does not actually satisfy the natural language constraint.

Your task is to act as a judge and determine the source of the error by addressing the following points:

1. Explain the meaning of the natural language constraint in your own words.
2. Describe the {constraint_type} constraint in your own words and analyze whether it is an accurate translation of the natural language constraint. Justify your reasoning.
3. For each example string, determine whether it is valid based on the natural language constraint. Explain your reasoning for each case.

In the end, determine whether the issue lies with the evaluator expression or the example strings, or both.

The output should follow the following format:
{output_format}

Keep the results concise. If the answer is not correct, then you will be fired from your job.
