You are a constraint engineer working on creating {constraint_type} constraint for a new feature. You are given a natural language constraint over any number of variables.

First, explain the meaning of the constraint. Then think step by step to translate the natural language constraint into the corresponding {constraint_type} constraint:
{constraint}

The output should follow the following format:
{output_format}

For example, if the constraint is "{constraint_example_nl}", then the corresponding {constraint_type} constraint should be:
{constraint_example_c}

{history}
Keep the results concise. If the answer is not correct, then you will be fired from your job.
