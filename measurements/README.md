## Measurements
This directory contains notebooks to reproduce the tables and figures in the paper for each research question (RQ). Each notebook is named according to the RQ it addresses. The notebooks use the results generated by the scripts in the `scripts` directory and the data in the `results` directory.

## Install Jupyter Lab
To run the notebooks, you need to install Jupyter Lab. You can do this by running the following command in your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

## Run Jupyter Lab
To run the Jupyter Lab, execute the following command in your virtual environment:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
This will open Jupyter Lab in your default web browser, where you can navigate to the `measurements` directory and open the notebooks.

## Reproduce Results
There are two notebooks:
* `evaluation.ipynb`: Reproduces the results for RQ1 and RQ2, which covers the performance of the LLM-based checker generation and string generation separately.
* `rq3.ipynb`: Reproduces the results for RQ3, which covers the performance of string generation with LLM-based checkers.
