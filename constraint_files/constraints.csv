German IBAN,"A German IBAN consists of 22 characters which are characterized as follows:
The first two characters represent the country code (here, the constant “DE”)
while the third and fourth characters are a checksum. The remaining 18 digits
represent the Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN).
We can compute valid IBANs using a given country code as follows: Represent
the country code as a digit where “A” equals 10, “B” equals 11, etc. The German
country code “DE” is hence encoded as 1314. Concatenate two zeros to the
encoded country code (i.e., 131400) and prepend the BBAN. ","1. The length of the bank number is 22
